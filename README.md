## Core challenges:

1. How to balance individual contributions with centralized curation, for both
   manual edits and scripted changes
2. Codebase that moves really fast

Implications:

- Cannot require database schema changes for new ontological categories
- Need a way to suggest & verify & merge a scripted change
- Scripted changes need to run somewhere that's easy for end users

## Don't worry about:

1. Multitenancy
1. User data
